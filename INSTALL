INSTALLING MOJOMOJO
-------------------

<URL>

1. Download the source (which you're probably already done, given you're
reading this file!)

2. Run the following command while in the directory containing the MojoMojo
files:
    perl Makefile.PL
(Module::AutoInstall should already be installed for this to work)
NB. This requirement will go away once we make a dist of MojoMojo

This will check your system to make sure that all the appropriate dependencies
are installed, if they aren't then make files will be created to install them,
if this is the case then you should run the following command as root:
    make
and follow the on-screen instructions. This may take some time as dependencies
may have further dependancies which also need to be downloaded.

2. Tests be can run using the following command:
    CATALYST_DEBUG=0 TEST_POD=0 prove --lib lib/ t/

Changing the first 0 to a 1 will result in extra debugging information from
the Catalyst engine.

3a) The easiest option for a database is SQLite The database is typically
located at db/sqlite/mojomojo.db. It can be recreated either by running:
    ./db/sqlite/mojomojo_create_db.pl <options>
or using the sqlite3 CLI to import db/sqlite/mojomojo.sql
or using the one that's already bundled with mojomojo, if you use sqlite3

b) The alternative (and generally better) is to use MySQL.
(i) Create a database, for instance:
    mysql -u root -p < `CREATE mojo_database`
(ii) Create a user and grant appropriate permissons, for instance:
    mysql -u root -p < `GRANT ALL ON mojo_database.* to mojo_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'`;
(iii)
    mysql -u user mojo_database -p < db/mysql/mojomojo.sql
Replacing mojo_database, mojo_user and password as needed.

or

c) Another option is to use Oracle. The database schema which needs to be
imported can be found at db/oracle/mojomojo.sql and an appropriate user will
need to be created. (Note: This schema is probably not up to date at the time
of writing)

4.a) Catalyst includes a test server which can be started using:
    ./scripts/mojomojo_server -p 3000
where 3000 is the port number and the default if no port is specified.

or

b) Set up Apache using either mod_perl or FastCGI.

See
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Cookbook.pod#Using_FastCGI
for further information.

5. mojomojo.yml is the main configuration file and is in YAML format.

Unless using SQLite as your database, you will need to set appropriate fields
under
Model::DBIC:
    connect_info:

If your server is connected to a http proxy you may need to add the following
line:
using_frontend_proxy: 1

Note that you should use spaces for indenting when using YAML, rather than
tabs.
